There's a source of about magnitude 1.0 on Array 1 that's not recovered ... maybe fourth largest
A big one on Array 2 (magnitude 1.5+, 13-56.5 sec) hasn't been recovered ... try again!  I got it by processing 10-22 sec on Array 2, (1.2, 10.7) to (1.8, 11.5).  Maybe it's Source C.  Had to lower maxcorrthresh one notch to get them to show up.  (1.0 thresh bad); two of the points were clean, one also overlapped another source; try extracting again using various groups of two.  OK, got it, in bbsp0149box2.  Not very good recovery, but easily analyzable by ear
1.2 on Array 3.

One false short call on channel 2 at 43 ex-sec
From 17-22 sec, C and E are right on top of each other (presumably due to more distant sources).  B comes in at 17 and by 18 falls into the slot after C/E.  A comes in at 19 and by 22 is in the remaining slot after B and before C/E.  Then at 22, C shifts over on top of A.  After 3 collisions, A shifts over to collide with E, and they stably stay this way until 37, well after D joins around 34 sec and eventually messes it up.  The distance between A and E is largest, so this is in fact the best choice of who should collide from the four A/B/D/E!
I tried extracting from 30-40 sec on Array 3; peak level about 0.5; no frames exceeded default limits; fiddling with parameters brought nothing.  Just too small.  Tried on Array 2; successfully recovered a scratchy burst at meanlocs =  (8.8244  6.4427  0.4973) from 4-6.5 sec, so maybe that's Source F!  Peak 0.64, thresh 0.18.  But other recovery attempts were unsuccessful; only extracted the one pulse they selected.

It looks like there's a distant frog not extracted that collides with different ones, giving the largest peaks.  It seems to sync with one, then another.
3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 seem to interleave with perfect synchrony until 3.1 comes in; 3.1 collides with all three in turn, then settles in to colliding with 3.4.  After 3.4 drops out, shifts to interleaving with 3.2 and 3.3
Source B seems to be there and to be recoverable, but I failed when I tried to get all of them from Array 3.  No sign of B in Array 2.  Source F really seems to be absent.

OBSERVATIONS and IDEAS:

They don't like to call alone; slow, tentative, stop soon if others don't take up the chorus.  Why?  Predation?  More attractive to females?

They start off slow and increase pace once they get going; is this only when syncing with others, or even when calling alone?

They do try to slot themselves into the gaps between neighbors.

Can we do the simple overlap analysis to show that they avoid colliding with each other?
And show that scratchy occurs in high-overlap situations?

Same type thing to show that scratchy occurs when more neighbors are calling?

Should go back to previous year's data with playback and see if you can get anything.

Can we identify triggers for scratchy?  (How many collisions, e.g.?)

Do average background level rise as trigger for chorus to begin ... to nearest microphone.

Come up with a metric of crowdedness to quantitatively test scratchy hypothesis ... say min level of 0.05-sec intervals over pulse interval; if this is high, there's not a gap for interleaving calls

Make a "precedence matrix" that compares pairwise the number of times each frog precedes others in a bout; if not consistent, there's no bout leader!

Make movies of each bout: assign location according to nearest array, flash with each call, and see if the wave action is apparent!

Can compute energy on all three arrays for, say, 2 seconds or 5 seconds before onset of first local caller,
and use ratios of those as a crude indicator of wave direction.
I bet we'll see strong correlation with which local frog starts first!

Build mic array fixture out of Connexs!  Should be possible to control positions well, and easy to assemble and take apart!

No point in trying to extract really distant stuff in loud chorus.  Max range in heavy chorus about 5 m?

Try using the adaptive capability in robustafunc and see if you do better!

Make histograms of intercall intervals, and of intercall intervals following collisions.  The latter will probably have far more 1.5s and 0.7s (scratchies).

Make scatterplot of successive intercall intervals, x being first interval, y being second, both all and those on either side of a collision

Find median intercall interval for each frog.

Scratchy intercall interval seems to be 3/4 of usual; this should be good for hitting any unused slots, since it's relatively prime to 3/3 slots they use!
See tail end of bbsp0113box3 57-61 sec, where frogs 3.1 and 3.3 they beat 4 vs 3!  Thus collide only every 4th pulse with any of three synced interferers!

Count total calls in each bout!  (Ratnam suggestion.)  Is it more consistent than duration?

Should compute intensity on one mic from each array for, say 1 sec
intervals for the entire night!  This may illuminate wave behavior.

It looks like they don't do scratchy here at the peak of the chorus, but they shift around who they alternate and who they collide with.
How can this form of collision avoidance and three-way TDMA be quantified statistically?

Could the purpose of the scratchy call be to jam the chorus?  If I can't get in, mess everyone else up?  Maybe test by seeing if other frogs
lose synch after a scratchy episode by a neighbor.

Do they go scratchy before they go fast, as a warning?  Doesn't look like it in 0181 Source C; normal nonscratchy at 40.99 sec, scratchy at 41.41 sec and thereafter.

HOW TO ANALYZE DATA:
- Take all bouts, all together, compute overlap statistics for all times that both frogs are calling over the whole period and show that it's less
  than random expected.
 - Also see if it's less for neighboring frogs
 - if we assume number_of_calls*(1/on_time_fraction) = number of "slots", binomial distribution should give us number of expected collisions between
   frogs if random; can estimate p-value from that.
- Compute inter-frog inter-onset delay intervals, and show that those are not uniform, but strongly peaked at 1/3, 2/3 median intercall interval.
  This will support 3-slot theory as well as interleaving
- For frogs far from edge (Frog A, maybe B), show that overlap is near zero during times only three frogs are calling (if there's even enough such intervals!) 6 sec at end of 0190, 4 sec at end of 0191, 5 sec at end of 0195, 5 sec at end of 0196, 5 sec at end of 0197, 10 sec at end of 0198 (YES, it seems to happen here; before 38, A and D overlap, but when the others drop out, they quickly shift to 3-way interleaving), 9 sec at end of 0199, 4 sec at end of 0200.  Not really any such times to speak of for Frog B.  4 sec for C, 9 sec for D at beginning of 0192 (YES! perfectly interleaved up until 19 ex-secs, or 7 seconds after 4th and 5th sources enter), 3 sec for D in 0193, 6 sec for both C and D at beginning of 0196, 7 sec for D at beginning of 0197, 3 sec for C, 2 for D at beginning of 0198, 2-3 sec for both in 0199.  All together, this may be enough to get some decent stats; 50-100 pulses

It looks like the backoff interval is 4/3, not 1.5!  See 0191.

Frogs are better synched, collide less w nearer neighbors.  Show by
- overlap matrix
- mod 1/3 phase histogram stats
- -1/6 to 1/6 percentage from phase histogram

Frogs sync with/key off locally dominant callers when they enter the chorus, try to stay locked to them.
- what broke up 0190 is that frog A dropped a call at 22 sec.  B went 4/3 waiting for it, and then got confused; A stayed locked to C, then switched to B at 25 sec when B collided w C

They lock by entraining 1/3 behind locally dominant caller when they enter

In 0191, at 14 sec A does a 4/3 for no obvious reason ... why?
- F started to enter just before that ...
- at 19, 3 drops a pulse and goes 5/3+.  This new phase overlaps 1, which goes 4/3.  This collides with 2, which drops out for two pulses and comes back in 1/3 earlier in phase
- F loses lock about then and precesses thereafter
- around 24, B shifts forward 1/3 relative to D; E drops out; C goes 4/3 and seems to sync to B, which A has been faithfully following
- at 26, B drops a pulse and delays an additional 5/3 and appears to sync on A after that!  Whereas A seems to be locked to C in those times.  B remains faithfully locked to A to the end, whereas they're free-running with respect to F.

In 0179, second frog in takes 1/3 slot; third frog jostles [5 3 4]
  E 2; C 3; D 7; B 10; A 11
  A achieves weak lock to B at 12, w C around 15, full lock w all at 20. Sync w E at 2/3 from 12.5-15.5 and C from 15-19 seems lower variance, but later on, 1/3 to D then E is best
  B seems to be followed by A from 12 sec; C at 17, all at 20
  B locks to E at 13, loses it at 15, then locks to D at 1/3 at 17 to 20, then switches to A at 19-24, then loses it
In 0180, second frog in takes 1/3 slot; third jostles for about 8 sec [5 3 2]
  E 4; C 7; B 8; A 12; D 18
  B locked to C for five calls at 12; slips to 2/3 after 14, then locks to E at 15.5 and A at 18
  A briefly locked 1/3 to B at 16, slips to 2/3 at 19, then 1/3 locked to C at 19.  A slips a 1/3 phase with everyone there
In 0181, 3 and 2 come in about the same time; 2 takes 1/3 slot, 3 takes 0/3 slot [5 2=3]
  E 14; C 15; B 15; A 19; D 33
  A locked w B at 1/3 at 21, E at 2/3 at 21; 1/3 phase slip at 23, then C at 1/3, B at 2/3, E at 3/3 by 24
  B locked w A (A following B) by 22; all by 23
  B locked onto C at 1/3 at 18, phase slip to 2/3 at 22
  B locked onto E at 1/3 from 18-36; A drops into 1/3 slot at 24-38
In 0183, second frog takes 1/3 slot; third jostles around for about 8 sec; meanwhile fourth comes in, and in the mixup second jumps to 2/3 slot.  Hmm, somehow frog 4 slips in a bit of a gap between 5 and 3 and it looks like 3 slips to following 1/3 behind it! [5 3 4 1]
  E 2; C 4; D 5; A 11
  A locks to 1/3 after E at 15-21; also 2/3 wrt C; never resyncs after 21
In 0184, 6 carries through alone from 0183, then 2,1,4 all come in at the same time.  It takes them 5 seconds to sync up to 6.
  F 0; B 11; A 12; D 12; C 13; E 13
  A,B locked from start (11)-30 sec, B 1/3 behind A
  A locks 1/3 later to D,E at 15; E slips to 3/3 at 18, but A stays with D until 27.5
  Nobody synced w F until 16
  D following B from 15

In 0185, 5 starts; 3 locks on 2/3 fairly quickly; 2 takes about 3 sec to sync.
  E 3; C 7; B 10; A 13; D (13)15
  B locks 1/3 after E 14-17 or A at 14.5-25.6
  B's intercall intervals slowly decrease until 25; does it get tired and/or lose the ability to keep up?  Is that what breaks the synced chorus?
  A locks 1/3 after C at 14; 2/3 after B at from 14-26, E at 3/3 from 14-17.  at 17, slips to 1/3 after E until 20, 2/3 after C; A 1/3 after C after 19-31
In 0186, 5 starts; 3 locks quickly to 1/3; 4 comes in next and takes about 6 sec to sync to 5, but all the others are coming in very soon after as well.  But the other four all lock to each other much earlier, by 13 sec
  E 6; C 8; F 8; D 10; A 10; B 12
  A,B both lock 1/3 to D at 13; E drifts into sync w D at 15, then A,B follow 1/3 after E at 17-21 as D slips. They then are 1/3 behind C from 21, then A switches to following B at 23, while B stays locked to C until 26
  A,B overlap until 22
  At 13.3 where A,B sync w D, E drifts onto collision w D and C just so happens to coincide with A,B, thus leaving a good onset for A,B to latch on to!
In 0187 (a carry-through by frog D), 2 comes in first but sputters in and out, managing to lock at 1/3 only after about 8 sec of trying
  A follows 1/3 after D from 11.5-18, 23-31 sec
  B 1/3 after D from 10-15; follows A from 33-37
In 0188, C carries through; E comes in and settles into a 2/3 slot, although it looks more like C may adjust to 1/3 following (Is E a hotshot?).  D comes in a bit later and settles on 1/3 after E. B comes in at 10 sec and quickly locks on 1/3 after 3and4 (which overlap here).
It looks like they kind of drift around for awhile at a slower clock rate until they happen to land at 1/3 behind a big guy, then they lock instantly.
  A follows 2/3 after B from 29-40; 1/3 after D from 33-44
  B 1/3 after C from 10.5-5, D from 10.5-13; switches to 1/3 after E or 2/3 after C at 16-20
In 0190, E starts it off as usual; both D and C come in about the same time and lock to 1/3 on E, seem to throw each other off and others come in too and it takes a few sec for everyone to sync up
  E 2; D 3; C 4; A 6; B 7
  A locks 1/3 after C at 8-22; 2/3 after 8.5 on B,D from 8.5-22
  B syncs 2/3 after C at 7-22; 1/3 after A 8.5-22; 1/3 after E 11.5-22
In 0191, E starts it off; C comes in and quickly takes a 2/3 slot; D comes in and almost immediately grabs the 1/3 slot
  E 0; C 2; D 3; B 4; A 5; F 12
  A 1/3 after B 9-14 sec, C 10-14, F 13-19, E 14-19, C,D 20-24, B 21-26
  B 1/3 after E for 3 calls 8-9.5 then slips to 2/3 behind from 10-20, D 10-20
In 0192, D starts it off; E comes in and takes the 1/3 slot after D.  Then C comes in and takes 1/3 slot on E (or 2/3 on D, but it locked after a dropped D call on E)
  D 3; E 7; C 8; A 12; B 12.5; F 34
  A locks 1/3 after D from 15-24, E from 19-25
  B syncs 3 pulse on C 14.5-15.5,slips to 3 pulses of D from 16-17, then slips to A from 17.5-25
In 0193, F carries through from 0192; D comes next and starts to lock to 1/3, then C comes in and nabs the 1/3 slot, then F drops out.  This one is a bit messy all the way through.
  F 0; D 8; C 9; E 10; A 14; B 15
In 0195, E starts, D comes in first and grabs 1/3 slot; C tries a couple of calls at 2/3, then switches to overlapping D; B comes in and overlaps as well, then slips to 2/3s, with D immediately following to 1/3 after B = overlap of E
  E 3; D 4; C 4; A 6; B 6; F 25
  A syncs 1/3 after C at 11.5-13.5; this is 2/3 after D,E 11.5-13 (but those look incidental).
  A slips to 2/3 behind C at 14 as 1/3 on D (14-28),E (14-23); locks to F at 28-38
  B 1/3 after C at 10-13.5 sec, then 1/3 after A 14-23; C 24-26; A 32-36
  B 1/3 on E 7.5-9, which slips to 2/3 and stays there for 10-22 along with C
In 0196, E starts, C and D come in almost simultaneously; D immediately locks to 1/3 on E, C immediately locks to 2/3 is 1/3 of D
In 0197, D starts, C starts just before E; E locks to 1/3 as soon as it gets close to 1/3; C tries to lock at the same time but collides with E and slips to 2/3-D = 1/3 E.  B comes in very soon, too, and locks to C; A comes in very soon and locks to B.
In 0198, E starts; C comes in and locks to 2/3; D comes in and quickly locks to 1/3
In 0199, E starts again; C comes in and locks to 2/3 after a few calls; D comes in next but can't really lock for at least 6 sec
In 200, F carries through; E comes in and doesn't really lock to F (they're a long way apart, so this may make sense); C comes in and locks quickly to 2/3 E; D comes in and takes about 5 sec to lock to 1/3 of E; B takes about 5 sec to lock to 2/3 once it comes in
In 201, E starts as usual; C and D start almost simultaneously; C quickly locks to 1/3, D to 2/3; they hold that until F comes in and seem to rotate around to settle in as a whole 6-frog chorus

In 12 of the 20, the second or one of the simultaneous 2+3 take the 1/3 slot.
In 2 of the 20, sync not achieved for several seconds.
In 8 of the 20, C (always C, except for one where E follows C) locks to 2/3

How about defining a lock as a certain # or more calls in a row within the same relative phase interval.
- Look to see how long it takes to achieve a lock with anyone after entering:
  - correlate against # of competing frogs
  - do stats on locks
  - how long do locks last?  What affects this?
- Stability, phase of lock relative to distance?
- What is the phase of a lock relative to when they entered; who followed whom?
- If somebody's locked and the other drops out, how long will the follower delay before calling?

Frogs intercall interval longer when not locked ... hypothesize this is a strategy for precessing in phase to look for a new slot/frog to sync with

Frogs sync on 1/3 because
- less delay from trigger means more accurate, since frequency drift is cumulative
- less delay means less time for interfering events to slip in and cause problems
- This maximizes the recovery period AFTER own call to recover hearing and listen for new trigger (Brilliant, Ratnam!)

HOW TO PROVE IT!!!
- In general, lower variance of intercall delay implies synchronization with leading frog.  So we should measure the variance of intercall delay over nominally synced intervals and claim the lowest variance is the one it's synced to.
- The only caveat is that for timers, the timing delay error could be proportional to the delay, since the error is presumably a frequency offset, which accumulates linearly.  So we might expect that, if they synced on 2/3rds, the variance might be twice as high as a 1/3 sync and still be synced.  BUT ...
- If a frog were synced directly at 2/3 and only INDIRECTLY to a frog at 1/3, then the variance of the dude at 1/3 should be EVEN HIGHER, because it would include the sum of all of the jitters through the indirection!  So this analysis works!
- What about two synced to a third?
- We could DISPROVE my 1/3 hypothesis by finding situations when a frog is synced to 2/3 and there's nobody at 1/3.  If we look only at frog A and B, where we see all the nearest neighbors, we can look for this case; I bet we'll never see it.  Conversely, we can look for 1/3 without 2/3 to support the 1/3 hypothesis.  We can always go back to the raw recordings and look and see whether there's unrecovered energy in the 1/3 slot.

Is there a refractory period after calling in which they won't trigger to an onset, and does this trigger a slip?

The model as of 3/22/10:
- A frog calls starting at time 0 for about 0.1 sec
- There's a refractory period after this in which it accepts

One approach: build a statistical model that predicts next call time only from most recent call time of all frogs.  That is, no memory before that.
- Could compare empirically derived statistical model to joint pdf induced by a mechanistic model

Write a computer program that, given the call times for a bout (or merely given a frog's most recent call time and all calls of other frogs subsequent to that but before its next call), predicts the next call time for that frog.
- tune model and parameters to minimize error with this model

In 0179, at 19.2 sec A advances.  This is the shortest call A makes in the sequence, and it's late wrt C, which is potentially the new trigger (but lands partly on D, which had triggered it before); this suggests a minimum refractory period.  The call before, A was a bit early and C was a bit late, so it's possible that the gap got large enough for A to be triggered by C.  At 20.3, A introduces a 4/3 delay, thus putting itself back after D again in its prior slot.  The gap between C and D was a bit smaller, and the gap between B and C was considerably smaller, so maybe A couldn't see C's onset after B or offset before D so it slipped ... or maybe it was tired after two short intervals in a row and had to slip?
Now at 19.8, B shifts late relative to D, its prior trigger, and seems to lock to A, which now overlaps D.  B follows A next cycle through a 4/3 interval, thus abandoning D for A.

At 12.3, A locks to B, on its third above-threshold call.  It seems that it could have locked to C or D a cycle earlier, but that would have taken too short an 0.5 interval, which is perhaps too short for the first few calls.  Also, B is much closer to A.  B seems to sync to E at 13.3 but get a bit late at 14.8 (due either to D and C mostly overlapping E but a bit late, thus pushing the offset out, or it being just too fast for B this early in the bout) then slips even later at 15.35 with no excuse other than it can't keep up the pace, then it waits for 1.5 to 5/3, slotting after A (incidental?) at 16.1, then 4/3 to after D at 16.75, then finally locking to D at 17.3.

At 23.6, A goes a bit short (and B follows) and then lands on D in the slot behind C after  In this time, E goes long at 23.1, C goes long at 23.85, and D follows C on that.  Now B is following A which overlapped E, but as A shortens up and moves forward, B ends up slipping to D at 24.7.  (B's min intercall period, 0.449, occurs at 22.25 and is just not as small as A's 0.413 sec.)

At 27.3, E skips its slot to go 5/3 for its last call, but A stays right on the beat with no apparent trigger.  Hmm.  A goes a bit short, actually.  Both B and E go 5/3 here from their previous calls at 26.8, so C seems to have lost its trigger and goes 4/3 to the slot behind A, which it follows twice then drops two calls. A ends up following B,D at 28; which follow empty slots (hmm), but B seems unable to keep up (C's min intercall interval is 0.424) and slips a phase into following D then slips another phase at 31.7.
A falls in behind D at 28 and follows until 31.5, when A advances on top of it to follow B which triggers at 31.7; A then follows B until B drops out after 36.0.
A just seems to want to run faster than the others, so triggers early and drifts early?


In 0186, all six seem mostly locked and interacting from about 15-25 sec.  Actually, not so good; A seems to lose lock from 20-23, and F's never well locked
x In 0188, there never seems to be an interval with all six at once
In 0191, all six seem to sync from 15-20 sec.  Slips around 19-20, and F drifts off and seems to be synced with some other cluster, not this one
In 0193, most are in sync from about 17-37 sec, but slips every 2-3 sec, and except for 21-25 sec, there's always one or two that seem locked to a different cluster and drifting phase-wise; very interesting, perhaps!  NOT REALLY!
x In 0197, F is never really in sync with the others, except for maybe 23-25 ex-secs, and not to B in there.
In 0198, all nicely locked in fixed phase from 22-28, then E drops out.  A predictor does well on this one
x In 0199, no overlapping times when all present and locked
In 0200, never a time when F is locked, but A-E all strongly locked in fixed phase pattern from 16-25 sec  ALL VERY REGULAR AND BORING
In 0201, all six locked, with occasional slips, from about 13-23.  From 20-23(25?), three each on a phase, leaving one phase open!  Predictor not so great overall, but good from 21-27.

It's hard to show anythign with six frogs calling, since there's always one nearby.  Try times with fewer frogs!
